## Milestone 1: Inventory Plan
 
 [Aave Cloud Workload Inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1esom0DIDzEMOJR3puAHIi0CfxLHFpHhfApMMKVuMiJE/edit?usp=sharing) (Draft): an inventory of core services operating on centralized cloud infrastructure and a Centralization Risk Score for each.
  

## Milestone 2: Architecture & Migration Plan
 
 Enhanced architecture and work plan to mitigate Centralization Risk Score for each workload including.

 (todo: work products will be posted here)

 
## Milestone 3: Proof of Concept
 
 Enhancement of one (low impact) cloud workload to the prescribed decentralized cloud architecture to validate the plan.
